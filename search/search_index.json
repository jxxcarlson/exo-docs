Eventually this somewhat convoluted process will be reduced to something quite simple on Exosphere. Terminology An instance is a virtual machine A share is a kind of virtual volume that typically consists of many physical volumes on various physical machines. Accessing an Instance Locally In Exosphere go the Instances card Find your instance and click on it. In the new page, note the following info on the Credentials card: Floating IP Address Username Passphrase Now do ssh USERNAME@IPADDRESS and paste in the passphrase Setting up a Share A share, which we can think of as a virtual file system, can be created in Jetstream2 (and soon will be creatable on exosphere.) To set up share, navigate to the Shares page in Jetstream2. Click on + Create Share and fill in the resulting form: Share Name Size Share protocol: CephFS Share type: your only choice is cephfsnativetype The other fields are optional. However, do not check the box Make visible to users from all projects. * Now you must add an access rule. To do this, click on the triangular drop-down icon to the right of Edit Share which you will find on the right-hand side of the row in which your instance appears. Select Manage Rules, then click on the new button Add Rule which you will find on the right, above the row in which your share appears. Fill in the resulting form as follows: Access Type: cephx Access Level: choose the default read-write unless you need read-only . Acces To: Enter what will be your rule name. It should have the form USERNAME-SHARENAME-rule-N , where N = 1, 2, 3 ... Leave the other fields blank, then click the Add button. Now look at the row in which your rule appears. In the column Access Key , there will be a long string of letters ending with == . You will need this access key later, as well as the rule name. Accessing a Share To be able to access a share on a running instance, two files must be correctly configured: Your keyring file in /etc/ceph The /etc/fstab fild To set them up, ssh to your instance Keyring file It is important that your keyring file name obey certain conventions, namely as in this model. /etc/ceph/ceph.client.RULE_NAME.keyring [client.RULE_NAME] key = ACCESSKEY [client.joeuser-testinstance-rule-1] key = AQ...bw== fstab file You must add a line of the following form to your /etc/fstab file: PATH LOCAL_SHARE_NAME ceph name=RULE_NAME,x-systemd.device-timeout=30,x-systemd.mount-timeout=30,noatime,_netdev,rw 0 2 You already know about the RULE_NAME . For the LOCAL_SHARE_NAME , do something like mkdir /mydata in your instance. Then use mydata as the LOCAL_SHARE_NAME . For the PATH , go to Jetstream2, click on the name of your share in the mult-row display of shares so as to get the share detail. You will notice an item Path . Copy long string of numbers and letters you see there. Using the share Let's write something to a file on the share: $ sudo cat /mydata/foo.txt This is a tests ^D Then we have $ ls /mydata foo.txt $ cat /mydata/foo.txt This is a test","title":"Working with Shares"},{"location":"notes/#working-with-shares","text":"The notes below show how to set up a share using a combination of Exosphere , Jetstream2 , and your local terminal.
